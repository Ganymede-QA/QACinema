# QA Cinema Team Ganyede 

A repo for the QA Cinemas task undertaken by team Ganymede. The stack for this project is the MERN stack, developed using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

## Client Assignment

The client asked us for a website for a cinema website, with functionality for bookings, payments, and more. We drew up a MoSCoW chart and sent this to the client for confirmation. After confirmation, this is what the project requirements looked like:

### Want it working on your own machine, within a development environment?

Make sure you have downloaded all of the above technologies. Then fork and clone this GitHub repo.

## Available Scripts

When you have cloned the repo, we recommend starting your own MongoDB server at https://cloud.mongodb.com/. Follow the setup on the website, which is free and simple. When you've done this, add your key in 'config/keys.js'. Now navigate to the main project folder, and copy, paste, and run:

 `npm i mongoose cors concurrently nodemon @material-ui/core @material-ui/lab @stripe/stripe-js` 
 
 Now cd into the client folder, twice, using
 `cd client`
 
 and copy, paste, and run:
 
 `npm i bootstrap axios react-router-dom react-scripts es6-promise isomorphic-fetch google-maps-react @stripe/react-stripe-js`
 
Which installs all dependencies required. Once you have done this, run: 

 `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode the most comprehensive script we have defined, and will automatically open this in your browser at localhost:3000.
